title: Mod Categories
---

This is the list of categories that can be used when defining a mod in the [manifest](manifest).

If you need a new category or think an existing category should be split let us know with a GitHub issue.

| Category               | Description |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| Asset Importing Tweaks | Improving Asset Importing |
| Audio                  | Enhancements and tweaks related to audio |
| Bug Workarounds        | A mod cannot truly fix a bug, but we can work around it with an awful hack |
| Context Menu Tweaks    | Messing around with the context menu |
| Dash Tweaks            | Messing around with the dashboard |
| Developers             | Lower-level functionality intended for "power users" |
| Hardware Integrations  | Making unsupported hardware supported. This is some real technomancy. |
| Inspectors             | Tweaking inspectors |
| Keybinds & Gestures    | New ways to control the game |
| Libraries              | No standalone behavior. Intended to be used by other mods. |
| LogiX                  | Tweaking LogiX |
| Memes                  | Why do people keep making these? |
| Misc                   | Things that don't fit well into any category |
| Optimization           | Make Neos do less work for similar results |
| Plugins                | Not mods. Neos plugins require `-LoadAssembly` to work, and normally break multiplayer compatibility. |
| Technical Tweaks       | Lower-level functionality intended for "power users" |
| Visual Tweaks          | Changes how rendering works |
| Wizards                | A user interface that presents a sequence of dialog boxes that lead the user through a series of well-defined steps |
